p. The field data cache is used mainly when sorting on or faceting on a field. It loads all the field values to memory in order to provide fast document based access to those values. The field data cache can be expensive to build for a field, so its recommended to have enough memory to allocate it, and to keep it loaded.


h2. Settings since v0.90

From version 0.90 onwards, the amount of memory used for the field data
cache can be controlled using @index.fielddata.cache.size@. Note: reloading
the field data which does not fit into your cache will be expensive and
perform poorly.

|_. Setting |_. Description |
|@index.fielddata.cache.size@|The max size of the field data cache, eg @30%@ of node heap space, or an absolute value, eg @12GB@. Defaults to unbounded.|

h2. Settings before v0.90

|_. Setting |_. Description |
|@index.cache.field.type@|The default type for the field data cache is @resident@ (because of the cost of rebuilding it). Other types include @soft@|
|@index.cache.field.max_size@|The max size (count, not byte size) of the cache (per search segment in a shard). Defaults to not set (@-1@).|
|@index.cache.field.expire@|A time based setting that expires filters after a certain time of inactivity. Defaults to @-1@. For example, can be set to @5m@ for a 5 minute expiry.|
